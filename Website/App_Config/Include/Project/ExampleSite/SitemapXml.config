				SITE RULES

				You can customize the Allows and Disallows that are rendered in the robots.txt by site. Create a siteRules element as 
				shown below where the <siteName/> element is named after the sitecore <site/> element's name attribute value.
				
				NOTE THAT SETTING SITE RULES FOR A SITE WILL COMPLETELY OVERRIDE THE DEFAULT RULES
				
				You can't use both. However, Global rules will be included in every robots.txt response regardless of whether the site
				has unique rules.
